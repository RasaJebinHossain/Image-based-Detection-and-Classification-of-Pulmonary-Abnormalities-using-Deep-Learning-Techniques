# Image-based-Detection-and-Classification-of-Pulmonary-Abnormalities-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

This project uses deep learning to automatically detect lung diseases like COVID-19, pneumonia, and lung opacity from chest X-ray images.
Models used include ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B7, VGG16, and VGG19, all fine-tuned via transfer learning.
A dataset of 4,219 labeled X-rays was used, enhanced with data augmentation techniques.
The ensemble of ResNet-152 and EfficientNet-B7 achieved the highest accuracy of 93%.
VGG19 and VGG16 also performed well, reaching 91.5% and 90.5% accuracy respectively.
The system reduces human error and diagnostic workload for radiologists.
It improves healthcare access in remote and under-resourced areas.
Misclassifications mainly occurred between lung opacity and normal classes.
Challenges include high computational requirements for deep models.
Future goals include optimizing models and expanding validation on diverse datasets.
